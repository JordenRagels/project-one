# Rhythm Radar

## Don't be lost in a sea of sound. We'll get you rocking out no matter where you are!

### Description:
The Rhythm Radar app is a new way of searching for local venues in the area. By simply typing in your city, we are able to generate venues in the area as well as how far away they are in feet from the center of the city. Not only do we generate the addresses, distances, and names of the venues; but we also make it super convenient by displaying it all on our app using Google maps. We do all the hard work! All you have to do is show up to the show! 

### Usage:
Let's say you are planning a vacation with friends and decide you want to attend a show while on vacation. But wait, you are unfamiliar with the different venues in that area! With the Rhythm Radar, you are able to see all nearby venues and later find out what shows are happening at those venues. You will no longer get lost trying to guess where these venues are or how far away they are from the center of the city.
