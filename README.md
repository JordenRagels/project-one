# Rhythm Radar

## Don't be lost in a sea of sound. We'll get you rocking out no matter where you are!

### Description:
The Rhythm Radar app is a new way of searching for concert venues in your area. By simply typing in your city, we are able to generate what shows are happening in your area.
Not only do we inform our users what shows are around for a weekend of fun, but we also display the location of the venue for your personal convenience! Now you no longer have to separately search for a show and later lookup the venue. We do all the work for you!

### Usage:
Let's say that you are visiting a friend or family member in a different city. Both of you are wondering what to do for the duration of time you will be visiting. You then realize you have not attended a conert in such a long time! What a perfect thing to do on vacation. With the Rhythm Radar, you type in your location and within seconds you will find that concert you want attend as well as a great map that specifics how to get there using google maps. What a convenient way to search for your next concert!
